Hi there üëã

My name is Aynur, and I am a beginner QA engineer. Here, I share projects developed during my course.

üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªA few quick facts:

- üìñ I am currently learning manual testing and continue to develop my skills in this area.
- üìñI don‚Äôt have professional experience in QA yet, as I am still in the learning phase.
- üìñI enjoy the process of testing because I am always focused on accuracy and uncovering hidden issues. I feel that this activity aligns perfectly with my analytical skills and attention to detail.
- üìñFun fact: I am an ultrasound doctor, diagnosing human organs from the inside. Now, I want to diagnose programs from the inside! üòÄ
