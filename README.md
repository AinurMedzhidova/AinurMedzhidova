Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aynur, and I am a beginner QA engineer. Here, I share projects developed during my course.

A few quick facts:
- I am currently learning manual testing and continue to develop my skills in this area.
- I donâ€™t have professional experience in QA yet, as I am still in the learning phase.
- I enjoy the process of testing because I am always focused on accuracy and uncovering hidden issues. I feel that this activity aligns perfectly with my analytical skills and attention to detail.
- Fun fact: I am an ultrasound doctor, diagnosing human organs from the inside. Now, I want to diagnose programs from the inside! ðŸ˜€
